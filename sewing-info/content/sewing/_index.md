I'm currently learning to [repair sewing machines](tools/). This is a fledgling enterprise, and I'm not quite sure where it's going yet.

As an aside, _Polarweasel Gear_ was my custom sewn-goods company. I made and repaired fire and EMS gear, bags, laptop cases, dog accessories, and more. I am not currently accepting any new sewing work.
