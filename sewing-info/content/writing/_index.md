Based in Ladysmith, British Columbia, I provide technical documentation systems and services to clients worldwide. I've been doing this for over 25 years now, and clients like what I do.

Whether your organization is large or small, whether you need a writer for a short project or a documentation leader who can staff up and run your documentation team, let's help you create documentation and training that meets your needs: on-time, within budget, easily updated, and highly usable.

## What do I do?

As a technical writer, I specialize in creating **highly-technical documentation for developers and system administrators**, including API reference manuals, installation guides, and programmer's guides. I have also written a number of well-received user's guides.

## For whom?

I'm working primarily in SaaS and other cloud software these days, but have written for clients in television, GIS, finance, medical software, and consumer software, among others.

A selected client list includes the University of Toronto, Yugabyte, PubNub, Ericsson, eBay, Cable Television Laboratories (CableLabs), Alticast, and Pitney Bowes.

## Can I help you?
