Welcome to the show. I'm Alex Ball ([contact me](/contact/)), and I do two things from here:

[Technical communications](/writing/). I provide technical documentation systems and services to clients worldwide.

[Sewing machine repairs](/sewing/). This is a fledgling enterprise, and I'm not quite sure where it's going yet.

_Polarweasel Gear_ was my custom sewn-goods company. I made and repaired fire and EMS gear, bags, laptop cases, dog accessories, and more. I am not currently accepting any new sewing work.
