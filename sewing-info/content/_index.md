Welcome to the show. I'm Alex Ball ([contact me](/contact/)), and I do two things from here:

## Tech docs

[Technical communications](/writing/). I provide technical documentation systems and services to clients worldwide.

## Sewing-related content

I like to sew, and I like to learn how things work, so it was only a matter of time before I started repairing sewing machines... This is a fledgling enterprise, and I'm not quite sure where it's going yet. But go check out the [sewing content](/sewing/).

As an aside, _Polarweasel Gear_ was my custom sewn-goods company. I made and repaired fire and EMS gear, bags, laptop cases, dog accessories, and more. I am not currently accepting any new sewing work.
