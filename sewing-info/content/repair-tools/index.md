## Screwdrivers

Let's assume you're not working on anything overly modern here. Even so, you'll need several different flat-head screwdrivers, a few Philips, and who knows what else.

You'll appreciate a few **long-shaft screwdrivers**. I've got three so far:

* 4.0mm Wera XXX
* 5.5mm Wera XXX
* 1/4" XYZ

You might assume these are for reaching deep into the guts of the machine, but mostly they're useful for applying gentle torque to a screw that's stuck&mdash;the shaft twists, maintaining a baseline pressure level as you continue to work the screw.

A **1/4" hex bit driver handle**, and a number of bits:

* Slotted, metric:
* Slotted, imperial:
* Philips: #00, #0, #1-#4
*

If you're starting from nothing, consider Chapman's [starter set #9600](https://chapmanmfg.com/products/9600-starter-slotted-bit-set).

Whatever bits you choose, make sure the slotted bits are hollow-ground so they'll actually fit the screw heads well. Nicholas Rain Noe does a great job explaining why hollow-ground screwdriver tips are so great in [Getting Comfortable Wrenching on Your Machines: Screwdrivers, Part 1](https://vssmb.blogspot.com/2011/07/getting-comfortable-wrenching-on-your.html). (Check the rest of his [screwdriver articles](https://vssmb.blogspot.com/search/label/screwdrivers), too!)

## Wrenches and sockets

Sewing machines are a super fun mix of metric and imperial (SAE/inch) fasteners. If you know you'll only be working on a particular brand and vintage of machines, you *could* stock only metric tools, or only imperial, but really, just get both, because your luck is bound to run out sooner or later.

* **Metric sockets** in 1/4" and 3/8" drive sizes. The range should be something like 3-14mm.
* **SAE (inch) sockets** in 1/4" and 3/8" drive sizes. The range should be something like ???"-???".
* A **low-profile bar ratchet** like [the Vessel TD-70](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B001VB4OHM/) (no clue how good the bits are, though!) will come in handy for needle plate screws and other fasteners with low clearance above.
* **Metric open-end wrenches**. The range should be something like 3-17mm.
* **SAE (inch) open-end wrenches**. The range should be something like ???"-???".

## Pliers

Needle-nose are the main ones you're likely to need.

## Poky things

* Spudging tools are handy and cheap, and non-marring
* Prybars are tougher and not as cheap, and definitely will leave a mark

## Lubricants and solvents

* Super Lube is good universal grease (but NOT for Singer motors!)
* Sewing machine oil is also known as turbine oil. Buy a zoom-spout bottle of oil for half the cost at your local tool store.
* Kerosene, such as Coleman stove fuel. This stuff is really volatile, so store it in an HDPE or metal container; it evaporates right through my soft plastic oil bottles.
* Rubbing alcohol. I've got a pump dispenser that's pretty handy for dampening a cloth.

## Power tools

* Soldering iron
* Multimeter
