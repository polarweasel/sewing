## Screwdrivers

Let's assume you're not working on anything overly modern here. Even so, you'll need several different flat-head screwdrivers, a few Philips, and who knows what else.

### Long-shaft screwdrivers

You'll appreciate a few **long-shaft screwdrivers**. I've got three so far:

* 4.0mm slotted (0.8 x 4.0 x 300mm Wera 008027)
* 5.5mm slotted (1.0 x 5.5 x 300mm Wera 008060)
* 1/4" slotted (1/16" x 1/4" x 10", aka 255mm, Milwaukee MT214)

You might assume these are for reaching deep into the guts of the machine, but mostly they're useful for applying gentle torque to a screw that's stuck&mdash;the shaft twists, maintaining a baseline pressure level as you continue to work the screw.

### Screwdriver bits

A **1/4" hex bit driver handle**, and a number of bits:

* Slotted, metric: 0.6x4.5, 1x5, 1x5.5, 1x6, 1.2x6.6
* Slotted, imperial: 1/4, 9/32, 5/16
* Philips: #00, #0, #1-#4
* Robertson: #0-#4

If you're starting from nothing, consider Chapman's [starter set #9600](https://chapmanmfg.com/products/9600-starter-slotted-bit-set).

Whatever bits you choose, make sure the slotted bits are hollow-ground so they'll actually fit the screw heads well. Nicholas Rain Noe does a great job explaining why hollow-ground screwdriver tips are so great in [Getting Comfortable Wrenching on Your Machines: Screwdrivers, Part 1](https://vssmb.blogspot.com/2011/07/getting-comfortable-wrenching-on-your.html). (Check the rest of his [screwdriver articles](https://vssmb.blogspot.com/search/label/screwdrivers), too!)

## Wrenches and sockets

Sewing machines are a super fun mix of metric and imperial (SAE/inch) fasteners. If you know you'll only be working on a particular brand and vintage of machines, you *could* stock only metric tools, or only imperial, but really, just get both, because your luck is bound to run out sooner or later.

* **Ratchet handles** in 1/4" and 3/8" drive.

* **Metric sockets** in 1/4" and 3/8" drive sizes. The range should be something like 3-14mm.

* **SAE (inch) sockets** in 1/4" and 3/8" drive sizes. The range should be something like ???"-???".

* **Metric open-end wrenches**. The range should be something like 3-17mm.

* **SAE (inch) open-end wrenches**. The range should be something like ???"-???".

* A **low-profile bar ratchet** like [the Vessel TD-70](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B001VB4OHM/) (no clue how good the bits are, though!) will come in handy for needle plate screws and other fasteners with low clearance above.

  You might be able to use your 1/4" drive ratchet, too, but by the time you put on a square-to-hex adapter, the whole thing is going to be fairly tall.

  I've also got a Craftsman 41380 finger bit driver; handy, but definitely non-essential.

## Pliers

Needle-nose are the main ones you're likely to need.

## Poky things

* **Spudging tools** are handy and cheap, and non-marring.

* **Pocket-sized prybars** are tougher and not as cheap, and definitely will leave a mark.

* A couple of **smallish-sized punches** can be handy for getting stuff aligned.

## Lubricants and solvents

* **Sewing machine oil** is also known as turbine oil. Buy a zoom-spout bottle of oil for half the cost at your local tool store. The gentlest cleaner for finishes on very old machines.

* **Super Lube** is good universal grease (but NOT for Singer motors!)

* **Kerosene**, such as Coleman stove fuel. This stuff is really volatile, so store it in an HDPE or metal container; it evaporates right through my soft plastic oil bottles.

* **Rubbing alcohol**. I found a pump dispenser at the pharmacy that's pretty handy for dampening a cloth. May dissolve lacquer finishes; test first!

## Power tools

* **Soldering iron**
* **Multimeter**
* **Heat gun** (pen-style is nice to use for heat-shrink tubing)
