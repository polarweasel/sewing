title: 'Polarweasel: Heavy-Duty Sewing'
---

Polarweasel Gear was my custom sewn-goods company. I made and repaired fire and EMS gear, bags, laptop cases, dog accessories, and more.

I am a nationally-registered emergency medical technician, wildland firefighter, technical rescuer, and a dog owner. All of these demand durable, highly-functional gear, and I created just that.
